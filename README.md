# IPL-ANALYSIS- INDIAN PREMIER LEAGUE 

About This Project
This repository contains the IPL Analysis Dashboard project, which was developed in collaboration with future interns to analyze the performance of teams, players, and match statistics from the Indian Premier League (IPL) seasons 2008 to 2022. The analysis was conducted using Microsoft SQL Server for data processing and Power BI for building an interactive dashboard.

Key Features of the Project:
Title Winners and Key Player Stats: Visualizations of Title Winners, Orange Cap Winners, Purple Cap Winners, and key player statistics for each season.
Interactive Filters: Ability to filter bowling and batting stats to analyze individual player performance.
Winning Insights: Analysis of winning percentages based on toss decisions, matches won by venue, and total team wins across seasons.
Match Result Breakdown: Visualization of matches won based on different result types (e.g., by runs or wickets).
Tools and Technologies Used:
Microsoft SQL Server: For loading and querying the IPL dataset.
Microsoft Power BI: For building the interactive visualizations and dashboard.
This project serves as a practical example of how to integrate SQL for data manipulation and Power BI for visualization, making it a valuable resource for those interested in data analysis and visualization of sports data.
